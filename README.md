# magtag-apps

This repo houses the code for one or more magtag applications.

The [MagTag](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4800) is an IOT combination of an ESP32 module and 2.9" E-Ink Display.

I will be designing these based off the guide [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-magtag/overview-2) using the CircuitPython language installed on top of the UF2 [bootloader](https://circuitpython.org/board/adafruit_magtag_2.9_grayscale/).
